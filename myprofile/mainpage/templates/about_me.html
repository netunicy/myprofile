        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="text">
                <p>I'm Charalambos Pitris, a primary school teacher with a strong interest in software development.</p>

                <p>I studied Primary Education at the University of Cyprus (2007‚Äì2011) and have worked in both Cyprus and the UK.</p> 
                <p>My teaching journey began in Greek schools in London (2012‚Äì2013), and from 2018 to 2025, I worked in All-Day Primary 
                    Schools under the Ministry of Education, Sport and Youth in Cyprus. I am currently employed on contract in a public primary school within the Ministry.</p>

                <p>Alongside my work in education, I have grown as a self-taught programmer, focusing on web and software development.
                    I work with technologies such as Python, Django, Kivy, HTML, CSS, SQL, and deploy applications using Heroku. 
                    My projects rely on PostgreSQL for robust, secure, and scalable database management.</p>

                <p><b>Some of my projects:</b></p>

                <p>üåê <a href="https://cpitris.com">C.Pitris profile</a> ‚Äì An informational site featuring articles, links, and downloadable resources.</p>

                <p>üíª <a href="https://cpsoftwarecreation.com">C.P Software Creations</a> ‚Äì A content-driven page with texts, useful links, a contact form, and file upload functionality.</p>

                <p style='color:blue;'>üéì cpnetuni.com</p> ‚Äì My most ambitious project: <strong> A secure and feature-rich e-learning platform, currently under development. 
                    Built with Django and PostgreSQL, the platform includes:</strong>  
                <ul>
                    
                    <li><a><b>Full user authentication:</b> login, logout, password reset, username recovery/change, and email-based account activation.</a></li>

                    <li><a><b>Encrypted video playback via secure, time-sensitive URLs</b></a></li>

                    <li><a><b>Stripe integration for online payments, including cart and order tracking</b></a></li>

                    <li><a><b>Video usage analytics to monitor viewing frequency and duration</b></a></li>

                    <li><a><b>A modular, scalable backend with reliable data handling</b></a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The platform is not yet published, as educational content is still being prepared.</p>
                <p>My goal is to launch cpnetuni.com with a complete set of video-based content and offer everything at affordable prices, making high-quality learning accessible to everyone.</p>
                <p>All of my work is available publicly on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/netunicy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My profile</a>
                <p>I‚Äôm passionate about combining education and technology, aiming to build tools that support students, educators, and everyday users alike.</p>
